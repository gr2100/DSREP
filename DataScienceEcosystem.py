# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# Welcome to my Data Science Notebook. In this notebook, I will explore various data science concepts and tools.
# 

# Data Science Languages
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 

# Data Science Libraries
# 
# 1. Pandas
# 2. NumPy
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. Seaborn
# 5. Scikit-Learn
# 

# ## Data Science Tools
# 
# | Tool           | Description               |
# |----------------|---------------------------|
# | Jupyter Notebook| Interactive computing   |
# | SQL Server     | Relational database      |
# | Tableau        | Data visualization        |
# | TensorFlow     | Machine learning framework|

# ### Let's explore some arithmetic expressions using Python with some examples below :

# In[16]:


# Multiplication and Addition
a = 5
b = 3
result_multiply = a * b
result_addition = a + b
result_multiply, result_addition


# In[15]:


# Convert Minutes to Hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
hours


# __Objectives__
# In this notebook, we aim to:
# 1. Explore data science languages and libraries.
# 2. Create and evaluate arithmetic expressions.
# 3. Share our work using GitHub.
